# How to add extension for automation test in Mocha-js for [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=Mocha-js-add-extension)

If your webapp requires an extension for automation test in Mocha-js on Lambdatest, you can use the following steps to upload extension and run your test. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/mocha-selenium-sample).

# Steps:
## Step 1: Get the zip file (Skip this if you already have the zip file with you)

Note: You will need the Chrome Extensions's ID for this. I am referring it to as $ID$. You can get the $ID$ from the URL of the Chrome Extension page.
1. Install your desired chrome extension on chrome.
2. Go to Chrome's Extensions page (chrome://extensions/), Enable the developer mode (check the developer mode box) and take note of the ID for your desired extension.
3. Your extension will be located at:

For Unix, ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Extensions/$ID$

For Windows, C:\Users\<Your_User_Name>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\$ID$

For OSX, ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/$ID$

## Step 2: Upload the zip file to LamdbaTest using API

1. * [Use the LambdaTest extension upload API to upload the zip file to the backend.](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/api-doc/#/extensions/UploadExtensions)

2. Copy the link to your extension which will look something like - https://automation-prod-user-files.s3.amazonaws.com/extensions/orgId-XXXX/2.1.0_0.zip

## Step 3: Pass extension in capabilities

In `conf/single.conf.js` file, you need to update your capabilities. The capabilities object in the for the adding extension  are defined as:
```js
exports.capabilities = {
        'build': 'Mocha-Selenium-Sample', //Build name
        'name': 'Your Test Name', // Test name
        'platform':'Windows 10', // OS name
        'browserName': 'chrome', // Browser name
        'version': 'latest', // Browser version
        'visual': false,  // To take step by step screenshot
        'network':false,  // To capture network Logs
        'console':false, // To capture console logs.
        'tunnel': false, // If you want to run the localhost than change it to true
        "lambda:loadExtension": "https://automation-prod-user-files.s3.amazonaws.com/extensions/orgId-XXXX/2.1.0_0.zip"
};
```

## Run your test

```bash
npm run single
```
